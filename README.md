# 12-nodejs-mySQL

This application is a mock Amazon store that allows for different functions based on if you using from the customer or manager application. 

## Accessing Node and installing the proper npm packages. 
      First I needed to make sure that you have package.JSON install. In ther terminal, when you are in the right local file, run "npm init -y" to install.
      Next I installed the mySQL and Inqurier packages, as they are required to have the app operate.
